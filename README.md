# VR-Class

After my internship, where I explored how augmented reality (AR) can be used in a different way, I sought out a class in virtual reality (VR) world building outside of my college. I wanted to again explore how VR can be used to push the boundaries of physical reality. I decided to take my friend's artwork and make a virtual museum for her. The lighting in the scene is not physically possible in the real world. Most of the light sources originate from where the viewer would be standing. The artwork is also scaled up to be 50 feet tall, so the viewer can easily see all the detail and care that went into making it. These rooms were created and designed in Blender.

Each room represents a different stage in the artist's life and the lighting reflects that. The first room is all artwork she did while in 9th and 10th grade. The lighting is warm since, at this stage in her life, she was living at home under the care of her parents and had little stress in the world. The second room is art that was made in 11th and 12th grade when she was starting to look into and prepare for college. The lighting is bright and overwhelming which reflects how she felt about applications and leaving her warm home. The third room is art she made in college. The lighting has cool colors because she is now out of the house, and the world seems more daunting and uncertain. When looking at all three rooms together, you can see this artist's journey from adolescence into early adulthood.
